# Neural Rendering
 
+ View the files in this order: Multi-view geometry -> Differential rendering -> AutoDecoder Scene representation  
+ Some outputs are hidden by github thing. Original notebooks have outputs.  
+ All the codes are based on MIT course assignments. I've done the work on my own.

+ Contents of Multi-view geometry: Explore rigit-body transformations, camera parameters, and projections using pointcloud. Render a depth map, fuse multi-view depth into a single point cloud, compute epipolar lines.

+ Contents of Differential rendering: Representing 3D geometry (Neural Fields, voxel Grids, Hybrid discrete-continuous represenations), Differentiable Rendering

+ Contents of AutoDecoder Scene Represenation: Convolutional Auto-Decoders, Training auto-decoder of voxelgrid scene representations
